        Notes


    DOM = Document Object Model

    - The DOM is a structured representation of a webpage

    - The DOM is made up of a tree of nodes. Nodes are elements/tags (body, div, h1, p etc...)

    - Manipulating the DOM with vanilla JS is much faster as far as performance goes, although Jquery May be easier.
